# Pokémon Clicky-Game 

## Overview
Hello Pokémon Masters (or masters-in-training)! Welcome to the Pokémon Clicky-Game. This is a Pokémon-themed game that tests your ability and memory in tracking and choosing amongst a randomized array of images. Try as catch as many Pokémon as you can! But be careful. Don't click the same one more than once! 

P.S. Want to run mobile on-the-go? With its mobile-responsive interface, you can play the Pokémon Clicky-Game wherever you are!

### How To Play:
1. Upon start, a random order of Pokémon will appear on the screen. 
2. Click through the images you think you haven't seen yet. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered on the page will be shuffled in a random order.
3. If you correctly guess an image you haven't clicked before, the scoreboard will update and add increment +1 to your score. 
4. Click on the same image more than once, though, and your score will be reset to 0 and the game will restart.
5. The maximum score is 15 in a row. If you get 15 new images right in a row, you win!
