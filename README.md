# Deployed-Clicky

## Overview
Hello fellow Pok√©mon masters (or masters-in-training)! Welcome to the Pok√©mon Clicky-Game. This is a Pok√©mon-themed game that tests your ability and memory in tracking and choosing amongst a randomized array of images. Try as catch as many Pok√©mon as you can! But be careful. Don't click the same one more than once....(or you'll lose them all!)

### How To Play:
1. The application will render different images to the screen. Each image will listen for click events.
2. The application will track of the user's score. The user's score increments when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score will be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.
3. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffles themselves in a random order.
4. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.
5. The maximum score is 15 in a row. Are you up for the challenge? üò¨

### Installation:
