# Deployed-Clicky
Deployed Pok√©mon Memory Game Made With React

## How To Play
1. The application will render different images to the screen. Each image will listen for click events.
2. The application will track of the user's score. The user's score increments when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score will be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.
3. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffles themselves in a random order.
4. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game should restart.
5. If you get 15 images in a row right, you win!
